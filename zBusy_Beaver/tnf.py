# Oh, "Attacking the Busy Beaver 5" has a clearer description
# Does the first move need to print a one?

# A0 = B1L looks like the default start in "Attacking the Busy Beaver 5"
# E0 | E1 = H1L is the final one

# They even seem to be reasoning about the machines while they generate them
# This is a little annoying as the function can only be computed in order

# Hmm https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.03184.pdf
